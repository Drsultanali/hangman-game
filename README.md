# Hangman Game ðŸŽ¯

Welcome to the **Hangman Game**, a classic text-based word-guessing challenge! This Python implementation of Hangman allows players to test their vocabulary and problem-solving skills as they try to uncover a randomly selected word, one letter at a time.

## How It Works

In this game, a random word is chosen from a predefined list, and your goal is to guess the word by suggesting letters within a limited number of incorrect guesses.

### Features

- **Random Word Selection**: The game randomly picks a word from a list of common words, ensuring a unique experience each time you play.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess one letter at a time. Correct guesses reveal the letter's position in the word, while incorrect guesses reduce your remaining attempts.
- **Limited Attempts**: You have 6 incorrect guesses to uncover the word before the game is over.
- **Simple and Fun**: This is a straightforward implementation designed for fun and educational purposes, perfect for practicing basic Python skills.
